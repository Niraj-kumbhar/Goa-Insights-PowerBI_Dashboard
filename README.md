This project is based on my last trip expense information.

Basically, me and my friends had trip recently. <br>
after the trip, we were trying to understand our expenses. But it was too difficult
So I came with this Dashboard.

* We can see expense of all group together or we can select Specific person in dropdown
* We can see each one's contribution in percentage and actual expense in Rupees
* timeline for expense by each member
